                <li><h3>How to build a capsule wardrobe on a budget?</h3><br>A capsule wardrobe is a small collection of versatile pieces that can be mixed and matched to create a variety of looks. Building a capsule wardrobe on a budget can be a challenge, but it's definitely doable. First, let's talk about the basics. Every capsule wardrobe should include a few essential pieces, such as:<br>
                    A pair of jeans or trousers,<br>
                    A neutral-colored blouse or shirt,<br>
                    A neutral-colored cardigan or sweater,<br>
                    A versatile dress,<br>
                    A pair of neutral-colored shoes,<br>
                These pieces can be mixed and matched to create a variety of looks. With these basics, you can start to add in some trendier pieces. For example, a few statement accessories, like a pair of earrings or a scarf, can really elevate a look. Or, you could add a pop of color with a bright-colored top or bottom. And don't forget about shoes! A pair of stylish shoes can really elevate a look. Just remember to keep it versatile and within your budget.<br> </li>
